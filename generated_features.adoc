=== Auto Import
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/assists/src/handlers/auto_import.rs#L12[auto_import.rs]

Using the `auto-import` assist it is possible to insert missing imports for unresolved items.
When inserting an import it will do so in a structured manner by keeping imports grouped,
separated by a newline in the following order:

- `std` and `core`
- External Crates
- Current Crate, paths prefixed by `crate`
- Current Module, paths prefixed by `self`
- Super Module, paths prefixed by `super`

Example:
```rust
use std::fs::File;

use itertools::Itertools;
use syntax::ast;

use crate::utils::insert_use;

use self::auto_import;

use super::AssistContext;
```

.Merge Behaviour

It is possible to configure how use-trees are merged with the `importMergeBehaviour` setting.
It has the following configurations:

- `full`: This setting will cause auto-import to always completely merge use-trees that share the
 same path prefix while also merging inner trees that share the same path-prefix. This kind of
 nesting is only supported in Rust versions later than 1.24.
- `last`: This setting will cause auto-import to merge use-trees as long as the resulting tree
 will only contain a nesting of single segment paths at the very end.
- `none`: This setting will cause auto-import to never merge use-trees keeping them as simple
 paths.

In `VS Code` the configuration for this is `rust-analyzer.assist.importMergeBehaviour`.

.Import Prefix

The style of imports in the same crate is configurable through the `importPrefix` setting.
It has the following configurations:

- `by_crate`: This setting will force paths to be always absolute, starting with the `crate`
 prefix, unless the item is defined outside of the current crate.
- `by_self`: This setting will force paths that are relative to the current module to always
 start with `self`. This will result in paths that always start with either `crate`, `self`,
 `super` or an extern crate identifier.
- `plain`: This setting does not impose any restrictions in imports.

In `VS Code` the configuration for this is `rust-analyzer.assist.importPrefix`.

=== Format String Completion.
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/completion/src/completions/postfix/format_like.rs#L0[format_like.rs]

`"Result {result} is {2 + 2}"` is expanded to the `"Result {} is {}", result, 2 + 2`.

The following postfix snippets are available:

- `format` -> `format!(...)`
- `panic` -> `panic!(...)`
- `println` -> `println!(...)`
- `log`:
  + `logd` -> `log::debug!(...)`
  + `logt` -> `log::trace!(...)`
  + `logi` -> `log::info!(...)`
  + `logw` -> `log::warn!(...)`
  + `loge` -> `log::error!(...)`


=== Fuzzy Completion and Autoimports
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/completion/src/completions/unqualified_path.rs#L80[unqualified_path.rs]

When completing names in the current scope, proposes additional imports from other modules or crates,
if they can be qualified in the scope and their name contains all symbols from the completion input
(case-insensitive, in any order or places).

```
fn main() {
    pda<|>
}
# pub mod std { pub mod marker { pub struct PhantomData { } } }
```
->
```
use std::marker::PhantomData;

fn main() {
    PhantomData
}
# pub mod std { pub mod marker { pub struct PhantomData { } } }
```

.Fuzzy search details

To avoid an excessive amount of the results returned, completion input is checked for inclusion in the names only
(i.e. in `HashMap` in the `std::collections::HashMap` path).
For the same reasons, avoids searching for any imports for inputs with their length less that 2 symbols.

.Merge Behavior

It is possible to configure how use-trees are merged with the `importMergeBehavior` setting.
Mimics the corresponding behavior of the `Auto Import` feature.

.LSP and performance implications

The feature is enabled only if the LSP client supports LSP protocol version 3.16+ and reports the `additionalTextEdits`
(case sensitive) resolve client capability in its client capabilities.
This way the server is able to defer the costly computations, doing them for a selected completion item only.
For clients with no such support, all edits have to be calculated on the completion request, including the fuzzy search completion ones,
which might be slow ergo the feature is automatically disabled.

.Feature toggle

The feature can be forcefully turned off in the settings with the `rust-analyzer.completion.enableAutoimportCompletions` flag.
Note that having this flag set to `true` does not guarantee that the feature is enabled: your client needs to have the corredponding
capability enabled.

**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/hover.rs#L90[hover.rs]

Shows additional information, like type of an expression or documentation for definition when "focusing" code.
Focusing is usually hovering with a mouse, but can also be triggered with a shortcut.


=== Inlay Hints
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/inlay_hints.rs#L41[inlay_hints.rs]

rust-analyzer shows additional information inline with the source code.
Editors usually render this using read-only virtual text snippets interspersed with code.

rust-analyzer shows hints for

* types of local variables
* names of function arguments
* types of chained expressions

**Note:** VS Code does not have native support for inlay hints https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/16221[yet] and the hints are implemented using decorations.
This approach has limitations, the caret movement and bracket highlighting near the edges of the hint may be weird:

=== Magic Completions
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/completion/src/lib.rs#L29[lib.rs]

In addition to usual reference completion, rust-analyzer provides some ✨magic✨
completions as well:

Keywords like `if`, `else` `while`, `loop` are completed with braces, and cursor
is placed at the appropriate position. Even though `if` is easy to type, you
still want to complete it, to get ` { }` for free! `return` is inserted with a
space or `;` depending on the return type of the function.

When completing a function call, `()` are automatically inserted. If a function
takes arguments, the cursor is positioned inside the parenthesis.

There are postfix completions, which can be triggered by typing something like
`foo().if`. The word after `.` determines postfix completion. Possible variants are:

- `expr.if` -> `if expr {}` or `if let ... {}` for `Option` or `Result`
- `expr.match` -> `match expr {}`
- `expr.while` -> `while expr {}` or `while let ... {}` for `Option` or `Result`
- `expr.ref` -> `&expr`
- `expr.refm` -> `&mut expr`
- `expr.let` -> `let <|> = expr;`
- `expr.letm` -> `let mut <|> = expr;`
- `expr.not` -> `!expr`
- `expr.dbg` -> `dbg!(expr)`
- `expr.dbgr` -> `dbg!(&expr)`
- `expr.call` -> `(expr)`

There also snippet completions:

.Expressions
- `pd` -> `eprintln!(" = {:?}", );`
- `ppd` -> `eprintln!(" = {:#?}", );`

.Items
- `tfn` -> `#[test] fn feature(){}`
- `tmod` ->
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_name() {}
}
```

And the auto import completions, enabled with the `rust-analyzer.completion.autoimport.enable` setting and the corresponding LSP client capabilities.
Those are the additional completion options with automatic `use` import and options from all project importable items,
fuzzy matched agains the completion imput.


=== Matching Brace
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/matching_brace.rs#L7[matching_brace.rs]

If the cursor is on any brace (`<>(){}[]||`) which is a part of a brace-pair,
moves cursor to the matching brace. It uses the actual parser to determine
braces, so it won't confuse generics with comparisons.

=== On Enter
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/typing/on_enter.rs#L15[on_enter.rs]

rust-analyzer can override kbd:[Enter] key to make it smarter:

- kbd:[Enter] inside triple-slash comments automatically inserts `///`
- kbd:[Enter] in the middle or after a trailing space in `//` inserts `//`

This action needs to be assigned to shortcut explicitly.

VS Code::

Add the following to `keybindings.json`:

=== Semantic Syntax Highlighting
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/syntax_highlighting.rs#L38[syntax_highlighting.rs]

rust-analyzer highlights the code semantically.
For example, `bar` in `foo::Bar` might be colored differently depending on whether `Bar` is an enum or a trait.
rust-analyzer does not specify colors directly, instead it assigns tag (like `struct`) and a set of modifiers (like `declaration`) to each token.
It's up to the client to map those to specific colors.

The general rule is that a reference to an entity gets colored the same way as the entity itself.
We also give special modifier for `mut` and `&mut` local variables.


=== Show Syntax Tree
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide/src/syntax_tree.rs#L7[syntax_tree.rs]

=== Structural Search and Replace
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ssr/src/lib.rs#L6[lib.rs]

Search and replace with named wildcards that will match any expression, type, path, pattern or item.
The syntax for a structural search replace command is `<search_pattern> ==>> <replace_pattern>`.
A `$<name>` placeholder in the search pattern will match any AST node and `$<name>` will reference it in the replacement.
Within a macro call, a placeholder will match up until whatever token follows the placeholder.

All paths in both the search pattern and the replacement template must resolve in the context
in which this command is invoked. Paths in the search pattern will then match the code if they
resolve to the same item, even if they're written differently. For example if we invoke the
command in the module `foo` with a pattern of `Bar`, then code in the parent module that refers
to `foo::Bar` will match.

Paths in the replacement template will be rendered appropriately for the context in which the
replacement occurs. For example if our replacement template is `foo::Bar` and we match some
code in the `foo` module, we'll insert just `Bar`.

Inherent method calls should generally be written in UFCS form. e.g. `foo::Bar::baz($s, $a)` will
match `$s.baz($a)`, provided the method call `baz` resolves to the method `foo::Bar::baz`. When a
placeholder is the receiver of a method call in the search pattern (e.g. `$s.foo()`), but not in
the replacement template (e.g. `bar($s)`), then *, & and &mut will be added as needed to mirror
whatever autoderef and autoref was happening implicitly in the matched code.

The scope of the search / replace will be restricted to the current selection if any, otherwise
it will apply to the whole workspace.

Placeholders may be given constraints by writing them as `${<name>:<constraint1>:<constraint2>...}`.

Supported constraints:

|===
| Constraint    | Restricts placeholder

| kind(literal) | Is a literal (e.g. `42` or `"forty two"`)
| not(a)        | Negates the constraint `a`
|===

Available via the command `rust-analyzer.ssr`.

```rust
// Using structural search replace command [foo($a, $b) ==>> ($a).foo($b)]

// BEFORE
String::from(foo(y + 5, z))

// AFTER
String::from((y + 5).foo(z))

=== Workspace Symbol
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ide_db/src/symbol_index.rs#L142[symbol_index.rs]

Uses fuzzy-search to find types, modules and functions by name across your
project and dependencies. This is **the** most useful feature, which improves code
navigation tremendously. It mostly works on top of the built-in LSP
functionality, however `#` and `*` symbols can be used to narrow down the
search. Specifically,

- `Foo` searches for `Foo` type in the current workspace
- `foo#` searches for `foo` function in the current workspace
- `Foo*` searches for `Foo` type among dependencies, including `stdlib`
- `foo#*` searches for `foo` function among dependencies

That is, `#` switches from "types" to all symbols, `*` switches from the current
workspace to dependencies.
